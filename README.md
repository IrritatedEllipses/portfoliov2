# Portfolio for IrritatedEllipses

This is only the second iteration of my portfolio site where I attempt to advertise myself but it itself has gone through many iterations.

This site should be fully mobile responsive down to 320px and scale accordingly within a single media query. It also should pass contrast checks. The original implementation of my proof of concepts (read: GitHub repo display) is problematic. I don't want to put in a carousel but I also don't just want to display static cards of the small projects I've done. I'm considering using the GitHub API to automatically display my starred repo's in cards. We'll see how that pans out.
